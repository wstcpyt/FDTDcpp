# FDTDcpp
Finite difference time domain(FDTD) package in C++, which is used for simulating electric magnetic field in 
the thin film structure. The package including the following Computation Core: 
* BoundaryCore: used for 
defining the boundary condition (such as PMC, ABC, PML, TFSF). 
* FDTDCore and FieldCore used for 
updating the filed. 
* FrequencyDomainCore used for transfering field from time domain to frequency domain. 
* SourceCore used for defining the source type(such as point source or gaussian source). 
* StructureCore 
used for defining the thin film structure. 
* VisualCore used for visualization.
